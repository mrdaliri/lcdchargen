Click on the blocks to create a custom character which will automatically generate output.

The example ARM STM32 code generated defaults with the following connections:


| LCD Module | STM32 Port | STM32 Pin |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| RS         | D          | 8         |
| RW         | D          | 9         |
| Enable     | D          | 10        |
| D4         | D          | 11        |
| D5         | D          | 12        |
| D6         | D          | 13        |
